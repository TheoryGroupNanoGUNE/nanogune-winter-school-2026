# *Nanoscience on the Computer*
## Tutorial for nanoGUNE's Winter School

This tutorial was prepared for nanoGUNE's Winter School (February 4-6, 2026) and was organized by the Theory Group at nanoGUNE (Artacho, Milowska, Hernangómez, and Piaggi).

The tutorial covers the following topics:
- density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
- molecular dynamics simulations
- atomistic machine learning

The exercises have been prepared in Jupyter Notebooks which can be run using Colab or Binder.

**Authors:** Karolina Milowska, Daniel Hernangómez, and Pablo Piaggi
